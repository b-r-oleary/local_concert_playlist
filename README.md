# Local Concert Playlists

This library facilitates the creation of Spotify playlists that are based on upcoming local concerts, obtained from the SeatGeek API. This library requires API credentials for both Spotify and SeatGeek which are expected to be stored in environment variables as specified in `.env.sample`. An example script for generating such a playlist is provided in `local_concert_playlist/example.py`.
